# Refactoring Essentials for Visual Studio

[@vsrefactoring](https://twitter.com/vsrefactoring) | [vsrefactoringessentials.com](http://vsrefactoringessentials.com/)

Refactoring Essentials started out as NR6Pack, and was part of the NRefactory 6 repository. In the course of  
joint development, we made architectural tweaks that resulted in the two projects now being separate - which
makes them easier to maintain and contribute to.

Please note that Refactoring Essentials is at its heart a PCL (portable class library), which means it is x-platform and
not tied to Windows / Visual Studio.
